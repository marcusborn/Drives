1.0 - Problem: This is the first step to calculating the best RPM to change gears.

A brochure of a passenger car contains the following data:
Maximum torque of the internal combustion engine:
150 Nm at 3000 rpm
Torque range of the internal combustion engine:
90% of the maximum torque from 2000 rpm to 5000 rpm
Please draw the torque and power diagrams for this internal combustion
engine!

This graph shows us the torque charactaristics for this engine. It should be clear that the most efficient operational speed is at 3000rpm. This will later help us determine the optimal time to change gears.
