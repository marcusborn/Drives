A repository to help me learn about drives and also help others studying drive systems :)

This is a method to figure out the most efficient gear changes in a car with just some basic data. 

1.0 - Problem: This is the first step to calculating the best RPM to change gears with just very little data given in a broshure 

With data taken from a car broshure we know the maximum torque of the internal combustion engine is 150 Nm at 3000 rpm. The torque of the engine falls to 90% of the maximum torque at 2000 rpm and at 5000 rpm.

From here we can graph the curve of power and Torque.

This graph shows us the torque charactaristics for this engine. It should be clear that the most efficient operational speed is at 3000rpm. This will later help us determine the optimal time to change gears.
